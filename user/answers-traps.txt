1. Arguments will be available in a0, a1, a2...

2. There is no call to f() in main, the call has been optimized
   so that f(8) has been replaced by 12. g() has been inlined
   into f(), no call to g().

3. printf locates at 30+1536 = 1566, but comments say 630?

4. 38, the address of the next instruction.

5. i will be printed as "rld".

6. y will be an arbitrary value, since printf() thinks the 
   value of y resides in a1, it will fetch it from a1. But
   we didn't put any thing in a1, so a1 is a random number.
